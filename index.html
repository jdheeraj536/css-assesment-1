        The most common way to add css , is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However ,
        <mark>in this tutorial we will inline and internal styles ,</mark
        >because this easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it
        yourself.

    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs id , the different is that css class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID , on other hand , applies a style to one
      unique elements. ID is also special in that you can use aspecial URl to
      link directly to an element and it's used by javascript .
    </p>
    <p>
      in Css, Selector are used to target a specified element or range of
      elements on a web pages. Once an element has been targeted , a style or
      set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a wide range of a selector available. Two of the most Commmonly
      used are clasds and id . Both are used to target elmemnt to which a styles
      should be applied.
